Note: a more detailed readme will be available as I improve this tool, right now if you haven't worked with django I wouldn't try to use it. Most of the knowledge that went into the creation of this tool can be found in the Django "My First App" tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ more to come!

Basic Setup:
 change settings.py to your preferred database settings
 set up a new super user
 go to <site>/admin and create a new channel
 create your podcast(s)
